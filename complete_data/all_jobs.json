In fact, we were the first independent regulator of its kind in any of the world\u2019s democracies.\n Our mission is simple: we want to enable MPs to do what really matters by providing an exemplary, seamless regulatory service. We\u2019re guided by our values and our brilliant, inclusive culture ensures we\u2019re not only a great place to work but that we can also constantly adapt, evolve and improve everything we do so that we can meet our customers' needs.\n Take a look at some of our videos to find out more about who we are, what we do and how we do it:\n\n\n\n What do IPSA do?\n Working at IPSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Job description\n\n We\u2019re looking for a brilliant new team member to join us, who can help us deliver our mission and provide comprehensive support to our customers, ensuring their issues are resolved and options considered whilst ensuring MPs comply with the MPs Scheme of Staffing and Business Costs. The role is IPSA\u2019s first point of contact for our customers; offering advice, guidance and information, taking and making telephone calls, responding to emails and attending face to face meetings. The role also plays an important part in inducting and educating customers on IPSA\u2019s systems and processes and offers significant opportunity to contribute to the continuous improvement of operational activity that supports achievement of IPSA\u2019s strategic objectives.\n The Scheme can be perceived as complex and the role holder will need a full understanding of all its aspects, maintaining knowledge of relevant data, processes and systems to make life easier for MPs and their staff so they can focus on what really matters by delivering advice and support to MPs and their staff about how to access funding, manage budgets and ensure spending falls within the rules.\n We\u2019re looking for someone with excellent listening skills to help them understand our customers, and someone who can collaborate with other teams across IPSA to meet these needs efficiently and effectively, as well as fostering compliance with the Scheme of MPs\u2019 Staffing and Business Costs through customer service excellence. Speaking with customers and building strong and productive relationships is core to this role. MP Services is a forward thinking and high performing team that values its people and its customers and as we\u2019re fixated with continuous improvement, we need resilient people with a flexible mindset to help us evolve and improve.\n This is a brilliant opportunity for a calm and collected customer service champion, who thinks logically and works enthusiastically with all our colleagues and expressive customers to deliver an exemplary customer experience. \nMP Services Account Managers responsibilities include:\n\n Enabling MPs and their staff to comply with the Scheme through providing excellent customer service.\n Educating MPs and their staff on processes and systems.\n Supporting MPs and their staff to manage their financial position and budgets.\n Enabling MPs to register properties and claim reimbursements of business costs.\n Inputting data and monitoring accuracy of data to support decision-making.\n Supporting the process of validating business cost claims and recovering amounts over overspend, where necessary.\n Engaging with external stakeholders and collaborating with external partners. \nContributing to IPSA\u2019s continuous improvement culture.\n Undertaking other projects.\n\n The MP Services Directorate includes two customer-facing teams: one team delivers advice and support to MPs and their teams about how to access funding, manage budgets and ensure spending falls within the rules, while the other team delivers advice and support about how to register properties with IPSA to access the funding that goes with them. Depending on operational requirements, you\u2019ll be recruited to one of these teams at your time of appointment and you may be required to move between teams in future to continue to meet the needs of our customers and your own personal development.\n\n\n\n Person specification\n\n You\u2019ll be passionate about delivering excellent customer service and helping us to deliver our vision of enabling MPs to focus on what really matters by providing an exemplary, seamless, regulatory service.
